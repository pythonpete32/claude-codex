# API Server Integration Summary

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Core Integration ✅
- Created `LogTransformer` class in core package as a thin wrapper around `ParserRegistry`
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for LogTransformer (13 tests, 100% coverage)
- Preserved the rock-solid core package with minimal changes

### 2. API Server Integration ✅
- Updated all package imports from `@dao/*` to `@claude-codex/*`
- Created `TransformationService` to handle log transformation with correlation
- Integrated parsers into the enhanced history endpoint
- Fixed type issues by creating `FileLogEntry` interface

### 3. Tool Correlation Fix ✅
- Discovered that tool results come in separate user messages, not assistant messages
- Fixed `isToolResult()` to check user messages instead of assistant messages
- Updated `convertToCoreLogEntry` to preserve MessageContent array format
- Correlation engine now properly matches tool calls with results

### 4. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive manual testing guide
- Updated with correct API endpoints (port 3001, /api prefix)
- Added curl commands for testing all endpoints
- Documented expected responses and error cases

## Current State

The API server now successfully:
- Serves raw log entries via `/api/sessions/{id}/history`
- Provides parsed UI props via `/api/sessions/{id}/enhanced-history`
- Correlates tool calls with their results across separate JSONL entries
- Returns `parsedProps` for all supported tool types

## Test Results

Example of working enhanced history endpoint:
```json
{
  "uuid": "3ce3aa9a-01a5-4632-9a3b-f28a99d0d32b",
  "type": "assistant",
  "content": {
    "type": "tool_use",
    "id": "toolu_01N7WzjTsz1YoYCdPqfBAmgR",
    "name": "mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking",
    "input": {...}
  },
  "parsedProps": {
    "toolType": "mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking",
    "props": {
      "id": "toolu_01N7WzjTsz1YoYCdPqfBAmgR",
      "uuid": "3ce3aa9a-01a5-4632-9a3b-f28a99d0d32b",
      "timestamp": "2025-06-30T12:38:46.653Z",
      "duration": 0,
      "status": {
        "normalized": "completed",
        "original": "success"
      },
      ...
    },
    "correlationId": "toolu_01N7WzjTsz1YoYCdPqfBAmgR"
  }
}
```

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Failing Tests in log-processor (Low Priority)
- Duration test fails due to identical timestamps in fixtures
- Real-time monitoring test fails because FileMonitor doesn't emit events during initial scan
- These don't affect the API server functionality

### 2. Next Steps
- Create PR for the integration
- Deploy and test with real client
- Monitor performance with large log files
- Consider adding caching for parsed results

## Key Learning

The main challenge was understanding that Claude's JSONL format separates tool calls and results:
1. Tool calls appear in assistant messages with `type: "tool_use"`
2. Tool results appear in subsequent user messages with `type: "tool_result"`
3. Correlation happens via the tool ID (`id` in call, `tool_use_id` in result)

This separation required careful handling in both the log reading and transformation layers.
