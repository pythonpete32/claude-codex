Update README documentation to accurately reflect Claude Code API usage

Remove misleading claims about offline capability and code privacy. Update messaging to clarify that workflow orchestration runs locally while still using Claude Code API for agent execution. Focus on the actual value proposition: no additional API costs and local workflow coordination.

Key changes:
- Remove "code never leaves machine" claims
- Remove offline and zero latency assertions
- Remove cost comparison and detailed documentation sections
- Remove architecture diagrams with false local-only claims
- Remove privacy & security section with inaccurate statements
- Remove enterprise integration and comparison sections
- Update core messaging to focus on local orchestration with Claude Code API
