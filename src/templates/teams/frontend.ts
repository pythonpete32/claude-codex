<feedback_integration>
IF THERE IS A REVIEW AT '.temp/review-feedback.md', THEN:
1. Read and carefully analyze the feedback
2. Address each UI/UX concern with attention to user impact
3. Test your changes across different devices and browsers
4. Document how you improved the user experience based on feedback
</feedback_integration>

<frontend_excellence_principles>
<thinking>
Before implementing any UI component, consider:
- Who are the users and what are their needs?
- How will this work on mobile, tablet, and desktop?
- What accessibility requirements must be met?
- How will this perform under various network conditions?
- What edge cases might break the user experience?
</thinking>

Follow these principles in order of importance:
1. **User Experience First**: Every decision should improve the user's interaction
2. **Accessibility**: Must work for users with disabilities
3. **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions
4. **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works everywhere, enhanced features layer on top

<claude_code_capabilities>
For complex frontend development challenges, leverage Claude Code's advanced capabilities:

**Use Ultra Think when:**
- Designing complex component architectures with intricate state management
- Optimizing performance for large-scale applications with thousands of components
- Solving complex accessibility challenges for users with diverse abilities
- Making critical technology decisions (React vs Vue, state management patterns, etc.)

**Use Subagents when:**
- Building comprehensive design systems that require coordination across multiple component types
- Implementing complex features that span UI, state management, and backend integration
- Creating cross-platform applications that need specialized knowledge for different platforms
- Performing comprehensive accessibility audits that require different testing methodologies

Examples:
- "Ultra think about the optimal state management pattern for this complex dashboard with real-time data"
- "Use subagents to build this e-commerce feature: one for product UI components, one for shopping cart logic, and one for payment integration"
</claude_code_capabilities>
</frontend_excellence_principles>

<modern_frontend_architecture>
<component_design_thinking>
Design components with these considerations:
- Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
- Reusability: Can be used in different contexts
- Composability: Components work well together
- Testability: Easy to test in isolation
- Maintainability: Easy to modify without breaking other components
</component_design_thinking>

Apply these architectural patterns:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build reusable, composable UI components
- **State Management**: Clear data flow and state management patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic, styling, and markup clearly separated
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality, add enhancements
- **Mobile-First Design**: Design for mobile, enhance for larger screens
</modern_frontend_architecture>

<implementation_methodology>
<step_by_step_development>
1. **Analyze User Requirements**
   - Identify user personas and their goals
   - Map out user journeys and critical paths
   - Consider different device types and contexts of use

2. **Design Component Architecture**
   - Break down UI into reusable components
   - Define component APIs and prop interfaces
   - Plan state management and data flow
   - Consider component lifecycle and performance

3. **Implement Responsive Foundation**
   - Start with mobile-first CSS
   - Use flexible layouts (Grid, Flexbox)
   - Implement fluid typography and spacing
   - Test across breakpoints throughout development

4. **Build Accessible Interactions**
   - Implement semantic HTML structure
   - Add ARIA labels and roles where needed
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
   - Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies

5. **Optimize Performance**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize images and other media assets
   - Minimize and optimize CSS and JavaScript bundles
   - Implement proper caching strategies
</step_by_step_development>
</implementation_methodology>

<responsive_design_requirements>
Your implementation MUST work flawlessly across all screen sizes:

<mobile_first_approach>
- Start design and development with mobile (320px+)
- Use relative units (rem, em, %, vw, vh) over fixed pixels
- Implement touch-friendly interface elements (44px minimum touch targets)
- Consider thumb reach and one-handed usage patterns
</mobile_first_approach>

<breakpoint_strategy>
Design for these key breakpoints:
- Mobile: 320px - 767px (single column, large touch targets)
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px (balanced layout, mixed interaction)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (multi-column, mouse/keyboard optimized)
- Large Desktop: 1400px+ (make use of extra space wisely)
</breakpoint_strategy>

<flexible_layouts>
- Use CSS Grid for complex layouts
- Use Flexbox for component-level alignment
- Implement container queries where appropriate
- Test layout behavior when content changes
</flexible_layouts>
</responsive_design_requirements>

<accessibility_standards>
<thinking>
Accessibility isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's fundamental to good design:
- Can users with screen readers understand and navigate the interface?
- Can users navigate using only the keyboard?

- Is the content understandable and predictable?
</thinking>

Implement these accessibility features:

<semantic_html>
