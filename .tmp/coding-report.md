**Date**: June 23, 2025 - 03:07 AM

## ✅ Quality Gates Status
- Tests: **PASSED** (125 passed, 1 skipped)
- Linting: **PASSED** (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Build: **PASSED** (ESM + DTS builds successful)
- Coverage: **88.78%** (All files)

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the complete TDD workflow orchestration system including missing foundation dependencies. This involved:

### Core Components Implemented:
1. **Foundation Layer (Task 01)**: Core types, error classes, state management, shared utilities
2. **Operations Layer (Task 02)**: Git worktree operations, GitHub API integration, prompt utilities
3. **Workflow Orchestration (Task 03)**: Complete TDD workflow with agent coordination, CLI integration, environment validation

### Key Features:
- **TDD Workflow Orchestrator**: Iterative Coder ↔ Reviewer agent coordination with state persistence
- **CLI Interface**: Full argument parsing, validation, and command handling for `claude-codex tdd`
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Clean task execution with automatic cleanup
- **GitHub Integration**: PR detection and repository validation
- **Environment Validation**: Comprehensive preflight checks for all dependencies
- **State Management**: JSON-based task state persistence with atomic operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error classes with proper inheritance and context
- **Claude SDK Integration**: Subscription-enforced Claude Code SDK usage with message extraction

### Test Coverage:
- **126 total tests** with comprehensive mocking and error scenarios
- **88.78% coverage** across all source files
- Tests follow established patterns from @docs/TESTING.md
- Proper dependency injection for testability
- Both happy path and error scenario coverage

### TypeScript Quality:
- **Zero `any` types** - all properly typed interfaces
- **Strict TypeScript** configuration compliance
- **Proper error inheritance** with typed error classes
- **Interface segregation** for testability

### Architecture Highlights:
- **Dependency injection** pattern for testability
- **Agent coordination** through temp file reports
- **Stateful workflow management** with persistence
- **Clean separation** of concerns between layers
- **Subscription authentication** enforcement
- **Graceful error handling** with user-friendly messages

## Technical Compliance
- ✅ All functions match SPEC.md signatures
- ✅ ExtractFinalMessage function implemented in prompts.ts
- ✅ No unused imports or dead code
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Follows existing codebase patterns
- ✅ Claude Code SDK integration with forceSubscriptionAuth()

## Quality Metrics
- **125 tests passing** with 1 intentionally skipped test
- **No linting warnings** - clean Biome compliance
- **Successful build** - TypeScript + ESM + DTS generation
- **88.78% coverage** - comprehensive test coverage including:
  - `src/core/claude.ts`: 100% coverage
  - `src/cli/commands/tdd.ts`: 100% coverage  
  - `src/core/operations/github.ts`: 100% coverage
  - `src/core/operations/prompts.ts`: 100% coverage
  - `src/workflows/tdd.ts`: 90.29% coverage
  - `src/core/operations/worktree.ts`: 89.07% coverage
  - `src/shared/preflight.ts`: 100% coverage
