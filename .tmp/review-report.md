# Review Agent Feedback Report
**Task**: Operations Layer Implementation (Task 02)
**Review Date**: 2025-06-23 03:19 PST  
**Status**: ❌ CHANGES REQUIRED

## ⚠️ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. Test Coverage Below Threshold (BLOCKING)
**Problem**: Coverage is 87.96%, which is **below the required 90%** threshold
**Required Fix**: Add tests to achieve ≥90% coverage in these specific areas:
- `src/index.ts:4-46` - Main entry point exports (0% coverage)
- `src/core/operations/github.ts:140,147-148,155` - Error handling paths
- `src/core/operations/prompts.ts:44-47,76-79,133` - Error edge cases  
- `src/core/operations/state.ts:209,231,250,269` - State management error paths
- `src/shared/errors.ts` - Some error class constructors need testing
**Reference**: Review requirements mandate ≥90% coverage with meaningful tests

### 2. Missing Main Entry Point Testing (BLOCKING)
**Problem**: `src/index.ts` has 0% coverage despite being the main export interface
**Required Fix**: Create integration tests that verify all exported functions are importable and functional
**Reference**: Task 02 requires all operations to be tested and ready for consumption by orchestrator

## 📋 Quality Gate Failures
- ✅ Tests: PASSED (114/114 tests passing)
- ✅ Linting: PASSED (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- ✅ Build: PASSED (ESM + DTS builds successful)
- ❌ Coverage: **87.96% - FAILS ≥90% requirement**

## 🔍 Specific Code Issues

### Testing Gaps by File
**github.ts (94.21% coverage)**:
- Line 140: Error handling in `listPRsForBranch` 404 case
- Lines 147-148: Error re-throwing logic in catch blocks
- Line 155: Final error handling path

**prompts.ts (86.95% coverage)**:
- Lines 44-47: Error handling in `formatCoderPrompt` 
- Lines 76-79: Error handling in `formatReviewerPrompt`
- Line 133: Error handling in `extractFinalMessage`

**state.ts (90.77% coverage)**: 
- Line 209: File deletion error path
- Line 231: JSON parsing error path
- Line 250: Task state validation error
- Line 269: File write error handling

**index.ts (0% coverage)**:
- All exports need integration testing to verify they work correctly

### Missing Test Scenarios
- Error class instantiation and inheritance for all custom error types
- Integration tests confirming exports work as expected
- Edge case error handling in all operation modules

## ✅ What's Working Excellently

### SPEC.md Compliance: PERFECT ✅
- **Worktree Operations**: All 5 functions (`isGitRepository`, `getCurrentBranch`, `createWorktree`, `cleanupWorktree`, `listWorktrees`) match SPEC exactly
- **GitHub Operations**: All 3 functions (`getGitHubConfig`, `checkPRExists`, `listPRsForBranch`) implemented per SPEC
- **Prompt Utilities**: All 3 functions (`formatCoderPrompt`, `formatReviewerPrompt`, `extractFinalMessage`) follow SPEC templates

### Code Quality: EXCELLENT ✅
- Zero TypeScript errors and linting warnings
- Proper dependency injection for testability
- Custom error classes used correctly throughout
- Node.js protocol imports followed consistently
- Claude SDK types integrated properly

### Testing Foundation: STRONG ✅
- 114 comprehensive unit tests with good mocking strategies
- All critical business logic paths tested
- Error scenarios well covered (just missing edge cases)
- Good test organization following @docs/TESTING.md patterns

## 📝 Next Steps for Coding Agent

**PRIORITY**: Increase test coverage to ≥90%

### Specific Actions Required:
1. **Create `tests/index.test.ts`** - Integration tests for main exports
   ```typescript
   describe('Main Exports', () => {
     it('should export all operation functions', () => {
       // Test that imports work and functions are callable
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Expand existing test files** to cover the specific uncovered lines:
   - Add error edge case tests in `github.test.ts` for lines 140,147-148,155
   - Add error edge case tests in `prompts.test.ts` for lines 44-47,76-79,133  
   - Add error scenario tests in `state.test.ts` for lines 209,231,250,269
   - Test all error class constructors in error tests

3. **Verify coverage after changes**:
   ```bash
   bun run test:coverage  # Must show ≥90%
   ```

4. **Update completion report** with new coverage metrics

### Implementation is 95% Complete
The core functionality is excellent and matches SPEC.md perfectly. Only the coverage threshold needs to be met for PR approval.

## Iteration Count
This is iteration #2. Max iterations before escalation: 3.

## Quality Assessment
- **Architecture**: ✅ Perfect SPEC.md compliance
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Excellent TypeScript and patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ Strong foundation, just needs coverage boost
- **Integration Ready**: ✅ All functions ready for orchestrator consumption
